2. **How can Satispay offer a completely free service for personal accounts?**
We invented a new system that’s independent from credit/debit cards or a specific bank.
By eliminating these intermediaries, we were able to significantly increase our efficiency and reduce the costs for managing the payments, making the service completely free for personal accounts and extremely cheap for businesses. The sole cost for businesses is €0.20 only when a payment received is greater than €10. Now that is a revolution!
